Example Usage
____________________________________________________________________
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the system:

from model_objects import Product, ProductUnit, SpecialOfferType
from shopping_cart import ShoppingCart
from teller import Teller
from receipt_printer import ReceiptPrinter
from tests.fake_catalog import FakeCatalog

# Set up catalog and products
catalog = FakeCatalog()
apple = Product("Apple", ProductUnit.KILO)
catalog.add_product(apple, 1.99)

# Set up cart
cart = ShoppingCart()
cart.add_item_quantity(apple, 2)

# Set up offers
teller = Teller(catalog)
teller.add_special_offer(SpecialOfferType.TEN_PERCENT_DISCOUNT, apple, 10)

# Generate receipt
receipt = teller.checks_out_articles_from(cart)
printer = ReceiptPrinter()
print(printer.print_receipt(receipt))
